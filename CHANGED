fix formatting and organisation in SUMMARY
new section for non-literal types: builtin types
new page: enums, structures
deleted: "types" page as it covers user-defined types, and should be documented in Classes
deleted: types from "literals" that have no literal representation
clarify why there is no "builtin type" section for NamedParam
clarify why there is a callable `Complex()` typename bound, but no "Float" or "Integer" typenames
