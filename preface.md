# Preface

My name is Daniel Șuteu and I'm the original author of the Sidef programming language.

I had the idea about a new programming language at the beginning of 2013. The original desing was for an elegant, object-oriented programming language
that was easy to write, easy to parse and easy to implement.

I talked with a good friend of mine, Ioana Fălcușan, about this idea,
and together, we started the Sidef project in March 30, 2013 and we made the code public on Github. *Sidef* is a Romanian word that means *nacre* in English.

At the time of writing this book, Sidef is a little bit more than 2
years old. It is still very experimental and it lacks a solid and fast
implementation. It can be used, however, in home-made experiments and basic projects.

In this book I will try to cover the entire language specifications,
along with examples and notes. At the end of the book I will include a large collection of programming tasks written in Sidef, to give you a better grasp of the language.
