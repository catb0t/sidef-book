# Preface

My name is Daniel Șuteu and I'm the author of the Sidef programming language.

All started out as an idea at the beginning of 2013 when I talked with a good friend of mine, Ioana Fălcușan, about the concept of a new programming language. At that time, Perl was the language that we both knew and loved, so we thought it would be interesting to implement a new programming language in Perl as a learning excercise in the fileld of Programming Language Design.

Together we started the Sidef project in March 30, 2013 and we made the code public on Github. *Sidef* is a Romanian word that means *nacre* in English.

The original desing was for an elegant, object-oriented programming language that was easy to write, easy to parse and easy to implement. As the time passed by, the original design has been altered a little bit, but the core concept remained the same.

At the time of writing this book, Sidef is a little bit more than 2 years old. It is still very experimental and it lacks a solid and fast implementation, but it can be used in some simple projects.

In this book I will try to cover the entire language specifications, along with examples and notes. At the end of the book I will include a large collection of programming tasks written in Sidef, to give you a better grasp of the language.
