# Preface

My name is Daniel Șuteu and I'm a computer programmer born in Romania. I'm interested in many areas of computer science, including image and text processing, computational number theory and, more recently, programming language design.

In this book, we are going to take a complete tour of the Sidef programming language; a language which explores the features of the object-oriented paradigm.

All started out as an idea at the beginning of 2013 when I talked with a good friend of mine, Ioana Fălcușan, about the concept of a new programming language. Together we started the Sidef project in March 30, 2013 and we made the code public on Github. *Sidef* is a Romanian word which means *nacre* in English.

The original desing was for an elegant, object-oriented programming language that was easy to write, easy to parse and easy to implement. As the time passed by, the original design has changed a little bit, but the core concept remained the same.

At the time of writing this book, Sidef is a little bit more than 2 years old. It's still very experimental and it lacks a solid and fast implementation, but it can be used in some simple projects.

In this book I will try to cover the entire language specifications, along with examples and notes. At the end of the book I will include a large collection of programming tasks written in Sidef, hopping to give the reader a better grasp of the language.
