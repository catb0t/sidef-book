# Hash

An Hash is a dynamic collection of key-value pairs. The keys must be of type String, while values can have any type.

```ruby
Hash.new(
    a => 1,
    b => 2,
    c => 3,
)
```


Alternatively, there is another syntax for Hash literals (JSON-like):

```ruby
:{
    a: 1,
    b: 2,
    c: 3,
}
```
