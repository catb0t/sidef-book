# Integer

There are several ways possible to write an integer in Sidef. Each integer is represented by a `Math::BigInt` object.

Here is `255` written as integer in different bases:

```ruby
255;              # decimal
0xff;             # hexadecimal
0377;             # octal
0b1111_1111;      # binary
```
